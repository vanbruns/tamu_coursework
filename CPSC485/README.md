# Quantum Project

Originally developed in 2003, this project required significant updates to align with modern Java practices. With help from ChatGPT, I migrated the code to a Maven-based structure, replaced deprecated patterns, and began transitioning to a more maintainable architecture. Additional modernization is ongoing.
